# ALIENS_R_REAL
JavaScript and DOM Manipulation


The extra-terrestrial menace has come to Earth and we here at `ALIENS-R-REAL` have collected all of the eye-witness reports we could to prove it! 

We need you to write code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset. (StarterCode/static/js/data.js).
We also need to allow our users to filter the table data for specific values. There's a catch though... we only use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js on our web pages. They are the only coding languages which can be trusted.



* Create a basic HTML web page 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * Make sure you have a column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` at the very least.

* Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
